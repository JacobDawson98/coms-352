# Memory Mapped Files

A __memory-mapped__ file is a segment of virtual memory which has been assigned a direct
byte-for-byte correlation with some portion of a file or file-like resource. This resource is
typically a file that is physically present on-disk, but can also be a device, shared memory
object, or other resource that the operating system can reference through a file descriptor.
Once present, this correlation between the file and the memory space permits applications to
treat the mapped portion as if it were primary memory.

The memory mapping process is handled by the virtual memory manager, which is the same subsystem
responsible for dealing with the page file. In UNIX-based operating systems, memory mapped files
implement demand paging. Memory mapped files are loaded into memory one entire page at a time.
The page size is selected by the operating system for maximum performance. Since page file
management is one of the most critical elements of a virtual memory system, loading page sized
sections of a file into physical memory is typically a very highly optimized system function.

# Overall Objective

You are to write *two* C or C++ programs that manage a set of shared resources using UNIX memory
mapped files

You will submit 3 files for this project:
------------------------------------------
1. The file res.txt contains the set of available resources.

It can simply be of the form:
```
0 4
1 3
2 7
```

meaning that there are:

* 4 units of resource type 0,
* 3 units of resource type 1, and
* 7 units of resource type 2.

You may assume that the number of units of each resource is strictly less than 10.

2. The file __alloc.cpp__ implements a resource _allocator_ program.

* The allocator opens __res.txt__ and maps it to a memory region using the system call `mmap()`.

(You should make sure that the size of the region is not smaller than the file
size. To this end, you can use the `fstat()` system call to get the file size)

* In a loop, it keeps asking how many units of a resource type is needed.
* Once entered, it subtracts the units from that resource type (if available), and then
invokes system call `msync()` to synchronize the content of the mapped file with the physical file.

3. The file __prov-rep.cpp__ creates a Child process (so there are 2 processes):
    * The parent process:
        * opens the file __res.txt__ and maps it to a memory region (before forking the child
        process).
        * The parent process also acts as a _provider_ of resources.
        * In a loop, it keeps asking whether new resources need to be added.
        * If yes,
            * it receives from the user input, the resource type and the number of units, and
            adds them to the memory region.
        * Once added, using system call `msync()`, it synchronizes the content of the memory
        region with the physical file.
    * The child process:
      * The child process is a reporter and reports _three things_ every 10 seconds:
          * The page size of the system using the system call `getpagesize()`.
          * The current state of resources.
          * The current status of pages in the memory region using the system call `mincore()`
          (i.e., whether pages of the calling processâ€™s virtual memory are resident in core
          (RAM), and so will not cause a disk access (page fault) if referenced.)

Finally, notice that the memory mapped file itself is a shared resource and, hence, _access to
it must be mutually exclusive._

Thus, you will use _UNIX semaphores_ to enforce mutual exclusion.
Remember that UNIX semaphores are different from POSIX semaphores that you used in Project 1.

Here, you will use system calls `semget()`, `semctl()`, and `semop()`.
